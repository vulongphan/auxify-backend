We welcome all kind of contribution to the backend side of Auxify

## Repo Navigation
Navigating new codebase might be challenging and this is to help you get started! The functionality of each file is outlined as follows:
* `app.js`: server script
* `config.js`: contains config variables for the repo
* `.env`: contains environment variables for the repo
* `package.json`: contains a list of dependencies for the backend
* `controllers/action.js`: contains all backend API functions
* `data/index.js`: establishes MongoDB connection
* `models/room-model.js`: contains Schema for a document (which contains information about a room) in the database 
* `routes/router.js`: contains the endpoints and the corresponding API functions

To install the repository on your local machine, please refer to `installation.md`
